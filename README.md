- 👋 Hi, I’m @Kim-grant 

I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology with a concentration in Data Analytics, expecting to graduate in October 2025. My interest in cybersecurity has led me to enroll in the IBM Cybersecurity course, which I will begin shortly. This program will allow me to focus solely on developing the skills needed to become a cybersecurity analyst.

With a strong foundation in data analytics, I am particularly drawn to the intersection of data security and threat detection. My goal is to leverage my educational background and training to identify vulnerabilities and implement effective security measures. I aspire to contribute to a cybersecurity team where I can apply my knowledge, grow my expertise, and help organizations protect their valuable information.
